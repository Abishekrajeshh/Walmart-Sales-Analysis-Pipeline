# Walmart Sales Analysis: An End-to-End Data Pipeline üõí

Welcome! This project takes a deep dive into Walmart's sales data, building a complete data pipeline from the ground up. We'll start with raw data from Kaggle, clean and transform it using Python, load it into both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, and finally, use SQL to uncover powerful business insights.

If you've ever wanted to see how a real-world data analysis project is built‚Äîfrom messy data to strategic insights‚Äîthis is the place to be!

## üéØ Our Mission: Solving Business Problems with Data

At its core, this project is about answering key business questions that can help Walmart improve its operations and strategy. We're tackling challenges like:

* **üìà Revenue & Sales Performance**: Which branches and product categories are leading in sales? What are the biggest trends?
* **üì¶ Product Insights**: What are our best-selling products? Which product lines are the most profitable?
* **üï∞Ô∏è Customer Behavior**: When are our peak shopping hours? What are the most common payment methods? How can we use customer ratings to improve?

## üõ†Ô∏è The Step-by-Step Journey

This project follows a structured 10-step process to ensure a clean, logical, and repeatable workflow.

1.  **Setting Up the Environment**: We start by creating a structured workspace in VS Code, organizing our folders for a smooth development process.
2.  **Connecting to Kaggle**: We configure the Kaggle API to pull datasets directly into our project, making data acquisition a breeze.
3.  **Downloading the Data**: The Walmart Sales Dataset from Kaggle is downloaded and stored locally.
4.  **Installing Libraries & Loading Data**: We install all the necessary Python libraries (`pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, etc.) and load the raw data into a Pandas DataFrame.
5.  **Initial Data Exploration**: Before cleaning, we take a first look at the data using `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to understand its structure and identify potential issues.
6.  **Data Cleaning**: This is where the magic happens! We handle duplicates, fix inconsistent data types, and format currency values to prepare the data for analysis.
7.  **Feature Engineering**: To make our analysis richer, we create a new `Total Amount` column by combining `unit_price` and `quantity`.
8.  **Loading Data into Databases**: Using SQLAlchemy, we connect to both MySQL and PostgreSQL and load our cleaned DataFrame into tables, ready for querying.
9.  **SQL Analysis**: With the data in our databases, we write and execute complex SQL queries to solve the business problems we set out to answer.
10. **Documentation & Publishing**: Finally, we document the entire process and publish the project on GitHub for others to see and use.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to run this project yourself? Here‚Äôs how:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Walmart-Retail-Analytics-Pipeline.git](https://github.com/your-username/Walmart-Retail-Analytics-Pipeline.git)
    cd Walmart-Retail-Analytics-Pipeline
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    *It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment!*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set Up Your Kaggle API**
    * Make sure your `kaggle.json` file is in the correct directory (`~/.kaggle/` on macOS/Linux or `%USERPROFILE%\.kaggle\` on Windows).

4.  **Download the Data**
    * Use the Kaggle API to download the [Walmart Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-walmart-sales-dataset-of-45-stores).

5.  **Run the Pipeline**
    * Update the database connection strings in the main Python script or notebook with your credentials.
    * Execute the script to clean the data and load it into your databases.
    * Use the SQL scripts in the `sql_queries/` folder to run the analysis.

## üìà Results and Key Insights

Our analysis uncovered several key insights that could directly inform Walmart's business strategy:

* **Top Sales Drivers**: We identified the key product categories and branches that generate the most revenue.
* **Customer Preferences**: Our analysis revealed the most commonly used payment methods and the products with the highest customer ratings.
* **Peak Shopping Times**: We pinpointed the busiest days and times, providing valuable information for staffing and inventory management.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

This project provides a solid foundation, but there's always more to explore! Future enhancements could include:

* **Interactive Dashboards**: Integrating the results with a tool like Power BI or Tableau for dynamic visualizations.
* **Deeper Analysis**: Incorporating additional data sources (like weather or local events) to see how they impact sales.
* **Automation**: Building a fully automated data pipeline that can ingest and analyze new data in real-time.
